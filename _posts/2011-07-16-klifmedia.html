One of my first projects at KLIF Media was to redesign their site.

**Software**: Photohsop, Notepad++
**Programming**: WordPress, HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, jQuery UI

This was one of my first WordPress site (just learning WP for ~1 month then) that I think was more well done. It uses Custom Post Types/Taxonomies/Meta Boxes for Portfolio. For the Contact forms, its implemented using PHP/functions.php with admin pages for viewing form submissions stored in the database.

Design part, considering myself more of a developer, I was quite pleased with myself. Some highlights were the 4 artworks for the services section in the home page, the “paper-style” form and those squigly underline (in banner) & handdrawn arrows (mainnav)

<section class="gallery">
	<a class="lightboxLink" href="{{ site.url }}/img/portfolio/km-home.png" data-lightbox="klifmedia" title="Home page"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/portfolio/km-home.png" alt="Home page"></a>

	<a class="lightboxLink" href="{{ site.url }}/img/portfolio/km-portfolio.png" data-lightbox="klifmedia" title="Portfolio page"><img src="{{ site.url }}/img/portfolio/km-portfolio.png" alt="Portfolio page"></a>
