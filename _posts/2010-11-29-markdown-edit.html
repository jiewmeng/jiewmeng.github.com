##### The Problem

After using Markdown in StackOverflow for sometime, I grown fond of it and wanted to use it for any generic documents, an alternative for Microsoft Word for example. There wasn’t any app I found that uses it. Also Microsoft Word is bloated for my needs, plus, it isn’t good for code, no way I found to have syntax highlighting. So I started developing MarkdownEdit

##### The Vision

Word processing powered by Markdown

##### The Result

##### The making of

This app was developed at around the same time as QuickImageUpload, this is developed in C#/WPF/MVVM.

This app was a great learning experience for me. I 1st learnt how to have multiple closable tabs from this [MSDN Magazine Article](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx). Then other MVVM stuff like ICommands, since I was using MVVM Foundation, I used RelayCommands. I tried implementing the Editor in MVVM, but I discovered soon that its not really the best way to do it. In my ViewModels, won’t know whats the SelectedText etc. which is required to manipulate the selection etc. So I started encapsulating all those stuff in a UserControl. An advantage of this will be that it is reusable throughout different tabs. Then there is IO stuff like read/open, write/save. Then there is more advanced stuff like checking if the opened document has been edited outside the application.

It like QuickImageUpload is far from perfect, should be refactored, but I am thinking of focusing more on developing Web Apps from now. Maybe some apps for Envato Marketplaces like CodeCanyon, ThemeForest & Tuts+ Marketplace
